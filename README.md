# Insurance Expenses Analysis

Welcome to the Insurance Expenses Analysis project repository. In this analysis, we explore the intricate relationship between personal attributes, geographic factors, and their influence on medical insurance charges. By examining the dataset, we gain valuable insights into how age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits, and regional differences impact healthcare expenses.

## Analysis Details

### Situation:
Health HR required a detailed analysis of insurance costs for local patients.

### Columns in the Dataset:
1. **Age:** The insured person's age.
2. **Sex:** Gender (male or female) of the insured.
3. **BMI (Body Mass Index):** A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
4. **Children:** The number of dependents covered.
5. **Smoker:** Whether the insured is a smoker (yes or no).
6. **Region:** The geographic area of coverage.
7. **Charges:** The medical insurance costs incurred by the insured person.

### Task:
Analyze the impact of age, gender, BMI, children, smoker status, and region on insurance costs. Investigate average cost and total cost for trends and insights to identify future patient costs.

### Actions Taken:
- Developed pie charts for total costs by gender, smoker status, and number of children.
- Created horizontal bar charts for trends in average insurance costs by age gaps and BMI categories.
- Applied a correlation color-coded chart between age, BMI categories, gender, and insurance cost.
- Created a bubble chart for average insurance cost by age gaps and smoking habits.
- Implemented a filter slicer by region to show results for each part of the country.

### Results:

1. **Gender Impact:** Males have higher total insurance costs.
2. **Family Size Influence:** Patients with no children have higher total insurance costs.
3. **Age and Cost:** Patients aged 55-64 pay higher average insurance costs.
4. **BMI and Cost:** Patients with an obese BMI category pay higher average insurance costs.
5. **Gender, Age, and BMI:** Older males with overweight or obese BMI categories correlate to higher total insurance costs.
6. **Age and Smoking:** Older smokers pay higher average insurance costs.
